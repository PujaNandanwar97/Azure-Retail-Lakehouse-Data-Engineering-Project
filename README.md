📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Azure Lakehouse Data Engineering solution built using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, SQL, and Unity Catalog.

The project follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to transform raw retail data into analytics-ready datasets.

The implementation covers the complete ETL lifecycle—from raw data ingestion and cleansing to dimensional modeling and fact table creation—using cloud-native Azure technologies.

---

🎯 Business Problem

Retail companies generate large volumes of transactional data from customers, orders, products, sellers, payments, and reviews.

Raw operational datasets are not suitable for analytics because they contain inconsistencies, duplicates, and normalized transactional structures.

The objective of this project is to build a scalable Azure Lakehouse pipeline that transforms raw data into business-ready analytical datasets for reporting and decision-making.
